Algorithm Part 1: Checking for Narcissism in Numbers (Python)

Basically, a narcissistic number is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits it has.

P.S: They are also referred to as Armstrong numbers. Like 💪🏽 (Just kidding. ;) ) These special numbers are actually named after Michael Armstrong who discovered them.

So, for example:

```js
console.log("stuff bla bla")
```
